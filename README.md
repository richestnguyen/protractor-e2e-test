## Getting started

This package.json references the local protractor directory with `"protractor": "file: ../"`. For the type declarations to work, from the protractor directory run an `npm install` to generate the declarations file.

Next, install the exampleTypescript node_modules with:

```
npm install
```


## Protractor typings

To use Protractor types, you'll need to import `protractor`. After this is imported, you should have autocompletion hints when typing.

```
import {browser, element, by, By, $, $$, ExpectedConditions} from 'protractor';
```

Although the Protractor configuration file can be written in javascript, creating it in typescript will have some hints. These hints and the reference configuration can be found in `protractor.conf.js`.

## Ambient typings

Protractor also uses ambient types including jasmine, jasminewd2, and node. These are brought in via the `tsconfig.json` file, which uses npm module resolution to get types from `node_modules/@types`.

If you are using the jasmine framework for your tests, make sure to do:

```
npm install --save-dev @types/jasmine @types/jasminewd2
```

## Compiling your code

To convert your typescript to javascript (transpiling), you'll use the Typescript compiler (tsc). If you install typescript globally, the command is `tsc`. If it is not installed globally, the typescript compiler can be executed with `npm run tsc`.

## Running Protractor

After transpiling your code to javascript, you'll run Protractor like before: `protractor conf.js`
